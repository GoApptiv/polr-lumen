        {{ env('APP_NAME') }} is built on top of <a href="https://github.com/Cydrobolt/polr" target="_blank">Polr 2</a>, an open-source, minimalist link shortening platform. 
        While {{ env('APP_NAME') }} has been extensively customized for GoApptiv's internal use, its core functionality is powered by the Polr Project.
